Pulsed Regernative Braking for brushless motor controller with regenerative braking control signal

The file Pulsed Regenerative Braking V1.0.odg was created using Libre Office Draw application. It contains information on how to build a circuit board fitted into a jiffy box that can be used on an electric bike. If the brushless dc motor has a regerative braking signal, then this circuit can be turned on to pulse the braking signal once a second. The duration of the pulse is adjustable from approximately 300mS to 950mS.
